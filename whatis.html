        <p>With the rise of extremist behaviour across the country, it can sometimes seem like the change in people's behaviour comes out of nowhere.<br>The truth is that radicalization takes place over a long period of time, and it can be easy to dismiss early signals.
        <br><br>Below are a list of common signs to keep an eye out for in regards to radicalization.

            <summary>Spending an increasing amount of time online and sharing extreme views on social media.</summary>
            <span>
                Exposure to online propaganda can increase the desire for adventure for some people that involve potentially dangerous situations. This desire for risk taking can be exploited by radicalisers who are intent on recruiting susceptible people to participate in ‘exciting opportunities.’
                <br>Radicalisers are increasingly operating online to target and influence vulnerable people via online gaming and social media platforms. 
                <br>At first, they can use innocuous or typical looking pages or sites that are not extreme in any way. Then they will seek to invite the person into a ‘closed’ group where extremist views are expressed.  They do this to make the person feel special or part of a select group.</p>

            <summary>An obsessive or angry desire for change, ‘Something needs to be done!’</summary>
            <span>Is this person increasingly outspoken about certain topics or issues, and refuses to engage in a healthy manner?</span>

            <summary>Change in Behaviour and Hostility towards Others</summary>
            <span>Is the person you’re worried about reading, posting, watching or sharing hateful or extreme content and links? Are they secretive about which groups or people they are talking to online?</p>
