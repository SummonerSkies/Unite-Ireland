# PROTECT Ireland

## Overview

### Purpose
The goal of PREVENT Ireland is to create an informative webpage that introduces the general public to the Prevent strategy and its education goals regarding radicalization. To facilitate this, the site's content should be well-organised and easy to digest, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. When visiting the site, they should know:
- What is Prevent
- What is radicalization and how to recognise it, and
- How to report it to the appropriate authorities and/or community partners

### Target Audience
This site should be useable by anyone seeking general information on the topic. 

## User Stories

### Must-Have User Stories

As a user, I want a clear and concise homepage with a simple layout to help me find the information I need.
As a user I want to be reassured that the site is professional and provides accurate information.

### Should-Have User Stories
As a site owner, I want to display basic information on Prevent clearly and easily. 
As a user I want to be able to find the information quickly and easily, regardless of device used to access the site.
As a user I want a page that can direct me to find more information about Prevent’s initiatives
As a site owner, I want a responsive page allowing clear reading of information. 
As a user, I want to easily reach out to someone for help


### Could-Have User Stories
As a user, I want to know how to voice a complaint about Prevent
As a site owner, I want to redirect any complex queries to the relevant bodies


## Design Decisions

When designing the site, I wanted to reference the Irish flag colours to and include something celtic themed for the logo. 

### Wireframes

Starting with a clear front page with a hero image, I wanted to make sure the layout was clear and easy to follow.

When breaking down the above wireframes, I realised I had gone out of scope - I was making too many pages and making the project too complicated for myself. I took a step back, and changed the buttons, and merged together 'What is Radicalization' and 'Community Resources' together, and designed a page that could include a layout for both.

### Accessibility Considerations
Discuss how accessibility guidelines were adhered to, including colour contrast and alt text for images.  
**Guidance:** Outline how you've incorporated accessibility into your design, ensuring that your project adheres to guidelines such as WCAG.



## Features Implementation

### Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all must-have features)  
**Guidance:** Use this section as you complete Phase 2: Must User Stories Implementation & Testing. Document all the must-have features you implemented, explaining how they align with the user stories and acceptance criteria.

### Advanced Features (Should-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all should-have features)  
**Guidance:** Include any advanced features you implemented during Phase 3: Should User Stories Implementation & Any Advanced Features. Explain how these features enhance user experience and their alignment with the acceptance criteria.

### Optional Features (Could-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature (if any).
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature (if any).

(Include any could-have features that were implemented or considered)  
**Guidance:** If any could-have features were implemented, describe them here. This is an opportunity to showcase extra work done beyond the initial scope. But remember - keep it simple! Focus on the Must stories first. Could user story features are commonly earmarked for future project iterations.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
Summarize the results of testing across different devices and screen sizes.  
Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.  
**Guidance:** Summarize the results of your testing across various devices using tools like Chrome DevTools, as outlined in Phase 2. Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.

### Validation
Discuss the validation process for HTML and CSS using W3C and Jigsaw validators.  
Include the results of the validation process.  
**Guidance:** Document your use of W3C and Jigsaw validators to ensure your HTML and CSS meet web standards. Include any errors or warnings encountered and how they were resolved.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
Briefly describe the deployment process to GitHub Pages or another cloud platform.  
Mention any specific challenges encountered during deployment.  
**Guidance:** Describe the steps you took to deploy your website during Phase 4: Final Testing, Debugging & Deployment, including any challenges encountered.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
I successfully created a page and a general look that is quite nice, and laid out the goals of the site clearly.

### Challenges
I overscoped myself, and could have kept things much more simple. I did not achieve all the goals of providing information.

I did not leave myself enough time to do a WGAC check.

I did not budget my time well, and spent too long on wireframing, and looking for information over creating the page to include what it needed in full. I learned a lot about timekeeping and prioritization from this project.

### Final Thoughts
Provide any additional insights gained during the project and thoughts on the overall process.  
**Guidance:** Begin drafting reflections during Phase 1 and update throughout the project. Finalize this section after Phase 4. Highlight successes and challenges, particularly regarding the use of AI tools, and provide overall insights into the project.
